# Image-Light-and-Brightness-Adjustment

📝 Description

This project demonstrates how to adjust the brightness and darkness of an image in real time using OpenCV trackbars.
It’s an interactive mini-tool that allows users to control image intensity manually — great for learning how OpenCV handles image arithmetic and GUI elements.

⚙️ Features

- Real-time control over image brightness and darkness
- Two independent trackbars for precise adjustments
- Lightweight and easy to implement using OpenCV
- Works with any image format supported by OpenCV

🧠 Concepts Used
- Trackbars (cv2.createTrackbar) for user input
- Arithmetic operations on images (cv2.add, cv2.subtract)
- Named Windows (cv2.namedWindow) for dynamic display updates
- Simple event loop for continuous real-time response
